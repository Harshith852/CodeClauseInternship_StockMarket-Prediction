# CodeClauseInternship_StockMarket-Prediction with LSTM

This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices. It takes historical stock data as input and trains a model to make future price predictions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb` to train and test the model.

## Code Overview

- `Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire codebase.
- `data/HistoricalQuotes.csv`: Sample dataset for training and testing.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell.
3. You can modify hyperparameters or use your own dataset for training.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
